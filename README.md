# 🦾 Bare-AI-Agent: Autonomous Infrastructure Management

**Version:** 5.1.0-Enterprise (Hybrid Architect Edition)  
**Author:** Cian Egan  
**Date:** 2026-03-16  
**Repository:** [github.com/Cian-CloudIntCorp/bare-ai-agent](https://github.com/Cian-CloudIntCorp/bare-ai-agent)

Bare-AI-Agent is a multi-node, self-healing architecture designed to manage data pipelines and infrastructure integrity across Linux and Windows environments. The system supports **dual AI engines** — choose between the sovereign Bare-AI-CLI or Google's Gemini-CLI.

---

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The fleet follows a strict role-based hierarchy to ensure safety and scalability:

### 1. The Architect (Dev Console)
**Primary Host:** `penguin` (Chromebook/Debian)  
**Role:** Central command & deployment.  
**Key Tools:**
- `bare` — Hybrid AI assistant (auto-detects Bare-AI-CLI or Gemini-CLI)
- `bare-gemini` — Force Gemini engine
- `bare-sovereign` — Force Bare-AI-CLI engine
- `bare-engine` — Show current active engine
- `bare-enroll` — Deploy worker logic to remote nodes via SSH
- `bare-status` — Local telemetry audit

### 2. The Brain (Coordinator)
**Primary Host:** `bare-dc` (User: `bare-ai`)  
**Role:** Autonomous fleet monitoring and self-healing decisions.  
**Logic:** Runs the MAPE-K loop — harvests telemetry from workers, analyzes with an LLM, executes reflex commands via SSH.

### 3. The Workers (Fleet Nodes)
**Hosts:** Any enrolled Linux node  
**Role:** Telemetry reporting and payload execution.  
**Core Tool:** `bare-summarize` — outputs structured JSON telemetry for the Brain.

## 🤖 Hybrid Engine Support

| Engine | Type | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Bare-AI-CLI** | Sovereign, local-first | Air-gapped environments, Vault integration, maximum control |
| **Gemini-CLI** | Cloud-based | Google Cloud integration, latest models |

**Auto-detection:** `bare` detects which engine is installed and routes automatically (priority: Bare-AI-CLI → Gemini-CLI).  
**Override:** `export BARE_ENGINE=bare` or `export BARE_ENGINE=gemini`

---

## 📜 Naming Convention

| Type | Rule | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Installers | Must have `.sh` extension | `setup_bare-ai-worker.sh` |
| Tools/Artifacts | No extension | `bare-summarize`, `bare-enroll` |

Tools have no extension so the underlying implementation (Bash, Python, Go) can change without breaking system calls.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Note:** The repo can be cloned to any directory. All scripts detect their location automatically.

### 1. Setting Up a Worker Node

Run this on the target worker machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cian-CloudIntCorp/bare-ai-agent.git ~/bare-ai-agent

# 2. Run the worker installer
cd ~/bare-ai-agent/scripts/worker
./setup_bare-ai-worker.sh

# 3. Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc

# 4. Verify
bare-summarize
```

The installer will prompt you to select your AI engine (Bare-AI-CLI or Gemini-CLI).

---

### 2. Setting Up the Architect Console (Penguin / Dev Machine)

Run this on your developer machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cian-CloudIntCorp/bare-ai-agent.git ~/bare-ai-agent

# 2. Run the Architect setup
cd ~/bare-ai-agent/scripts/dev
./setup_bare-ai-dev.sh

# 3. Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc

# 4. Verify
bare-status
bare-engine
```

---

### 3. Setting Up the Brain (bare-dc)

Run this on your central coordinator machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cian-CloudIntCorp/bare-ai-agent.git ~/bare-ai-agent

# 2. Run the Brain installer
cd ~/bare-ai-agent/scripts/brain
./setup_bare-brain.sh

# 3. Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

> ⚠️ The Brain uses HashiCorp Vault for secure credential management. Ensure Vault is accessible and your AppRole credentials are configured before running.

---

### 4. Enrolling a New Worker from the Architect Console

Once the Architect Console is set up on Penguin, deploy to any remote node:

```bash
bare-enroll <user@host_or_ip>
```

Example:

```bash
bare-enroll bare-ai@10.0.0.25
```

The worker node will be staged, uploaded, and installed automatically.

---

## 🔧 Daily Usage (Architect Console)

```bash
# Start an AI session (auto-detects engine)
bare

# Force a specific engine
bare-gemini       # Use Gemini
bare-sovereign    # Use Bare-AI-CLI

# Check which engine is active
bare-engine

# Deploy to a new worker
bare-enroll bare-ai@10.0.0.25

# Check local telemetry
bare-status

# Navigate to repo
bare-cd
```

Session logs are automatically saved to `~/.bare-ai/diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with engine tagging (🤖 Bare-AI / ✨ Gemini).

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The Architect Console runs on your local dev machine — **never on production servers**
- The Brain's Vault credentials are **never stored in this repository**
- Workers operate with minimal permissions — telemetry reporting and reflex execution only
- All telemetry is logged locally in JSON format
- No data leaves your network unless you choose the Gemini engine

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security policy.
